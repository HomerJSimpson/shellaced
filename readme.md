# Watching Stargate Chronologically

So I've decided to watch StarGate according to the in-universe chronology of the Stargate universe...

Obviously I've decided to attempt to write a mobile first SPA using react/mui. The purpose of the app will be to track my watching progress within the Stargate universe and serve as a vehicle for learning. Long time readers will forgive my delusional belief that somehow this time will be different(you know what I mean).

Since I recently suffered through Stargate Origins, I'll likely begin with SG-1. I've seen the original film more than a few times and I'm not feeling it so that's why.

> Feature-length Stargate outings The Ark of Truth and Continuum offer a nice interlude after all that juggling, essentially wrapping up the SG-1 era.
> 
> Then, you can dive into the final two seasons of Atlantis and move on to the short-lived follow-up series Stargate: Universe, which ran for two seasons starring Robert Carlyle (COBRA). The show was eventually concluded in the form of a comic book.
